# Building an application with Dashboard

When you build an application using Dashboard you need to set up your Dashboard server on its own hosting and write your application.  Because Dashboard handles a lot of content for you your application only neeeds a `/` guest landing page and `/home` user application page to get started.

## Set up a copy of Dashboard

Dashboard is self-hosted and open source, you need to deploy it to eg Heroku or Digital Ocean or AWS before you can use.  Dashboard is a NodeJS project requiring node `8.12.0`.

    $ mkdir dashboard-server
    $ cd dashboard-server
    $ npm init
    $ npm install @userdashboard/dashboard
    # install any modules you want here
    $ echo "require('@userdashboard/dashboard').start(__dirname)" > main.js
    $ NODE_ENV="production" \
      DASHBOARD_SERVER="http://localhost:8000" \
      APPLICATION_SERVER="http://localhost:8001" \
      APPLICATION_SERVER_TOKEN="abcdef123456" \
      DOMAIN="localhost:8000" \
      node main.js

## Which storage backend?

Dashboard by default uses local disk, this is good for development and okay for applications that aren't going to grow to many users.  Alternatively you can use Redis, PostgreSQL or S3-compatible backends.  

| Name | Description | Package   | Repository |
|------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Redis | Very fast but expensive to scale | [@userdashboard/storage-redis](https://npmjs.com/package/@userdashboard/storage-redis) | [github](https://github.com/userdashboard/storage-edis) |
| Amazon S3 | Slow but cheap to scale | [@userdashboard/storage-s3](https://npmjs.com/package/@userdashboard/storage-s3) | [github](https://github.com/userdashboard/storage-s3) |
| PostgreSQL | Fast but not cheap to scale | [@userdashboard/storage-postgresql](https://npmjs.com/package/@userdashboard/storage-postgresql) | [github](https://github.com/userdashboard/storage-postgresql) |

Whatever storage backend you use may apply AES-256 encryption by specifying a 32-character encryption secret:

    ENCRYPTION_KEY="abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456"

## Which modules?

Modules add new pages and API routes for additional functionality.  Modules are NodeJS packages that you install with NPM:

    $ npm install @userdashboard/stripe-subscrpitions

You need to notify Dashboard which modules you are using in `package.json` conffiguration:

    "dashboard": {
      "modules": [
        "@userdashboard/stripe-subscriptions"
      ]
    }

| Name | Description | Package   | Repository |
|------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| MaxMind GeoIP | IP address-based geolocation | [@userdashboard/maxmind-geoip](https://npmjs.com/package/userdashboard/maxmind-geoip)| [github](https://github.com/userdashboard/maxmind-geoip) |
| Organizations | User created groups | [@userdashboard/organizations](https://npmjs.com/package/userdashboard/organizations) | [github](https://github.com/userdashboard/organizations) |
| Stripe Subscriptions | SaaS functionality | [@userdashboard/stripe-subscriptions](https://npmjs.com/package/userdashboard/stripe-subscriptions) | [github](https://github.com/userdashboard/stripe-subscriptions) |
| Stripe Connect | Marketplace functionality | [@userdashboard/stripe-connect](https://npmjs.com/package/userdashboard/stripe-connect) | [github](https://github.com/userdashboard/stripe-connect)

If you have built your own modules you may submit a pull request to add them to this list.  

### Write your application

The example above expects your application server to be listening on localhost:8001, it needs to serve a guest landing page on `/` and a `/home` page for your users.  At a minimum these are the only two pages your application needs to serve.

When it is ready you can open your application at `http://localhost:8000`, the first account to register is the website owner with the unique authority to assign and revoke administrators.  You will want to include `<html auth="false" template="false">` in your guest landing page.

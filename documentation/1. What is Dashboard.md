# Dashboard

Dashboard bundles everything a web application needs to launch into a parallel server so you don't have to focus on the repeatative features like how are your users going to sign in...

After setting up your own copy of Dashboard you still get to write your own application in any language you choose, but you already have a complete user and administrator interface for all the "web app boilerplate" functionality.  You can add modules to include organizations, Stripe Subscriptions and Stripe Connect platforms.

Dashboard sits over your application server and as users browse content will be served by either server.  When Dashboard proxies your application it provides user information in the request headers and you can use its API to expand on it.

| Application server | Dashboard & modules |
|--------------------|------------------|
| LANDING & GUEST PAGES | DASHBOARD |
| / | Signin and registration | 
| APPLICATION PAGES | Account management |
| /home | User administration |
| | DASHBOARD MODULES |
| | Organizations |
| | Stripe Subscriptions |
| | Stripe Connect |

## Customizing registration information

By default no information is required except username and password and they're both irreversibly encrypted.  Optionally, you can configure two settings to include personal information with the registration.

| Environment variable | value | 
|---------------------|---------|
| REQUIRE_PROFILE | true |
| USER_PROFILE_FIELDS | "comma,delimited,list" |
|                     | display-name|
|                     | display-email
|                     | contact-email
|                     | full-name
|                     | dob
|                     | phone
|                     | occupation
|                     | location
|                     | location
|                     | company-name
|                     | website
 
## Making Dashboard content look like your application

Dashboard URLs always map directly to files in `/src/www` except for two special CSS files that are ephemereal, they don't exist and blank responses are served [instead of a 404](https://github.com/userdashboard/dashboard/blob/master/src/response.js#L113).  Because they don't exist Dashboard tries to load these files from your application server.  Your application server can serve them to make Dashboard's content match your own design.

    /public/template-additional.css
    /public/content-additional.css

## Serving content

As Dashboard proxies your application you can return anything.  Any assets served from `/public/` will skip authenticating cookies etc.  Images, CSS, scripts and other formats are recognized.  Any assets you serve from outside `/public` will require the user be signed in.

You can also serve HTML content.  When Dashboard serves its own HTML content it is wrapped in a [template.html](https://github.com/userdashboard/dashboard/blob/master/src/template.html).  Your content will be wrapped in that template too unless your HTML specifies `<html template="false">`.  Your content can enable guest access by specifying `<html auth="false">`.

### Using Dashboard's navigation bar

If you are using Dashboard's template you can optionally use Dashboard's navigation bar for convenience:

  <template id="navbar">
    <a href="/home">Link 1</a>
    <a href="/other">Link 2</a>
    <a href="/page">Link 3</a>
  </template>

If you are using Dashboard's template your content can optionally provide HTML to add to Dashboard's template `<head>`:

  <template id="head">
    <!-- anything you put here -->
  </template>

## Overriding content

All Dashboard content is a HTML page + optional NodeJS pair, eg `change-password.html` and `change-password.js`.  They are always located in `/src/www` of Dashboard or its modules.  When your dashboard server starts up it will generate a `sitemap.txt` that shows you where each URL resolves.

The Dashboard originals:

    /node_modules/@userdashboard/dashboard/src/www/account/change-password.html
    /node_modules/@userdashboard/dashboard/src/www/account/change-password.js

Can be overriden by other modules using the same path:

    /node_modules/some-module/src/www/account/change-password.html
    /node_modules/some-module/src/www/account/change-password.js

And finally by your application:

    /src/www/account/change-password.html
    /src/www/account/change-password.js

## Overriding the template

Dashboard's template provides a typical web application structure with a header and content.  You can override this template with your own copy in your `/src` folder:

  /src/template.html

## Modifying Dashboard requests and content

Dashboard lets you modify requests as they occur through 4 injection points for executing your own code:

   1.  Receive request
   2.  Execute 'before' server handlers
   3.  Identify the user
   4.  Execute 'after' server handlers
   5.  Execute destination code
   6.  Execute 'page' content handlers
   7.  Execute 'template' content handlers

You can specify your own scripts to execute in your `package.json`:

    {
        "dashboard": {
            "server": [
                "/src/script1.js"
            ],
            "content": [
                "/src/script2.js"
            ]
        }
    }

### Server handlers

The `server handlers` run on requests before the destinate page or API route is executed.  Server handler scripts can execute `before` a user is authenticated or `after` when identified as a user or guest.  A server handler can provide both methods:

    module.exports = {
      before: async (req, res) => {
      },
      after: async (req, res) => {
      }
    }

### Content handlers

Content handler scripts receive a DOM-like [object representing](https://github.com/userdashboard/dashboard/blob/master/src/html.js) the page and template.  The page handler runs first, the template handler depends on the content not excluding the template via `<html template="false">`:

    module.exports = {
        template: async (req, res, templateDoc) => {
        },
        page: async (req, res, pageDoc) => {
        }
    }

## Validating requests came from your dashboard server

When Dashboard proxies yourr application server it includes header information about the user. 

    x-accountid
    x-sessionid
    x-dashboard-server
    x-dashboard-token
    
If your application and dashboard servers communicate over the open internet (ie domain1.com and domain2.com) then you should verify the requests.  The `x-dashboard-token` is a bcrypt hash derived from user information and a secret shared between your dashboard and application servers.  This is a NodeJS example of validating the request:

    function compareDashboardHash(req, callback) {
        if (!req.headers['x-dashboard-server']) {
            return callback(null, req)
        }
        if (req.headers['x-dashboard-server'] !== process.env.DASHBOARD_SERVER) {
            return callback(null, req)
        }
        let expected
        if (!req.headers['x-accountid']) {
            expected = process.env.APPLICATION_SERVER_TOKEN
        } else {
            expected = `${process.env.APPLICATION_SERVER_TOKEN}/${req.headers['x-accountid']}/${req.headers['x-sessionid']}`
        }
        const sha = crypto.createHash('sha256')
        const expectedHash = sha.update(expected).digest('hex')
        return bcrypt.compare(expectedHash, req.headers['x-dashboard-token'], (error, match) => {
            if (match) {
                req.verified = true
            }
            return callback(null, req)
        })
    }

## API access

Dashboard is completely API-driven and your application server has private HTTP access to it on behalf of the user making requests.  This example is NodeJS but in any language you must construct a token and make a HTTP request to the API route:

    const account = await getFromDashboardServer(`/api/user/account?accountid=${accountid}`, accountid, sessionid)
    const organizations = await getFromDashboardServer(`/api/user/organizations/organizations?accountid=${accountid}&all=true`, accountid, sessionid)

    const getFromDashboardServer = util.promisify((path, accountid, sessionid, callback) => {
        let hashText
        if (accountid) {
            hashText = `${process.env.APPLICATION_SERVER_TOKEN}/${accountid}/${sessionid}`
        } else {
            hashText = process.env.APPLICATION_SERVER_TOKEN
        }
        const salt = bcrypt.genSaltSync(4)
        const token = bcrypt.hashSync(hashText, salt)
        const requestOptions = {
            'dashboard.example.com',
            path,
            '443',
            'GET',
            headers: {
                'x-application-server': 'application.example.com',
                'x-dashboard-token': token
            }
        }
        if (accountid) {
            requestOptions.headers['x-accountid'] = accountid
            requestOptions.headers['x-sessionid'] = sessionid
        }
        const proxyRequest = require('https').request(requestOptions, (proxyResponse) => {
            let body = ''
            proxyResponse.on('data', (chunk) => {
                body += chunk
            })
            return proxyResponse.on('end', () => {
                return callback(null, JSON.parse(body))
            })
        })
        proxyRequest.on('error', (error) => {
            return callback(error)
        })
        return proxyRequest.end()
      })
    }

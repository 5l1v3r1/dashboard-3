# Production and scaling recommendations

Because of the limited responsibilies Dashboard servers, and the small data growth, it is the intention you can just set-and-forget Dashboard and it just work from 1 to 1 billion users without revisiting it.

    1.  Select scalable storage like Redis, PostgreSQL or S3, anything except local disk
    2.  Dashboard is designed to operate on Heroku with multiple dynos, or Digital Ocean and AWS with load balancers, operate + instances for redundancy.
    3.  Always use SSL for your Dashboard server address
    4.  Always use SSL if your application server is not on the same machine
    5.  Start your server with an automatically restarting process manager like [PM2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2) or [Forever](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever)

Encrypt your data at rest:

    ENCRYPTION_SECRET="32 character string"
    ENCRYPTION_SECRET_IV="16 character string"

Ensure passwords are strongly-hashed:

    BCRYPT_WORKLOAD_FACTOR="10"

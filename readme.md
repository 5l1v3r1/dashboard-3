# Dashboard

![Guest landing page](https://userdashboard.github.io/outline.png?raw=true) 

Dashboard is a parallel web application that accompanies your web app, subscription service, or Stripe Connect platform to provide all the "boilerplate" a modern web app requires to serve its users.  Use Dashboard instead of rewriting user account and login systems.
